This is the index page for my opinionated 11ty starter.

Its setup to use my preferred folder structure in addition to having having custom filters, an image optimization shortcode, 11ty-processed SASS, and a few more minor tweaks.

Included with the project is the [Natural Selection CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/frontaid/natural-selection) and Andy Bell's [Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/), both of which have been slightly modified.

The source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/higby/skeletor-starter). It's a template repository so all you have to do is press the big green `Use this template` button.

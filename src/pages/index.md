This is the index page for my opinionated 11ty starter.

It's setup to use my preferred folder structure in addition to having having custom filters, an image optimization shortcode, 11ty-processed SASS, and a few more minor tweaks.

Included with the project is the [Natural Selection CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/frontaid/natural-selection) and my personal [CSS Reset](https://github.com/higby/reset/).

The starter is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/higby/skeletor-starter). It's a template repository so all you have to do is press the big green `Use this template` button.

In addition, this site is kept on the [www branch](https://github.com/higby/skeletor-starter/tree/www).
